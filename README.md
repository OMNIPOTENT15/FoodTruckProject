# FoodTruckProject
Welcome to the Food Truck Project. To initialize the project:

1)Download the files src/com/skilldistillery/foodtruck/entities and src/com/skilldistillery/foodtruck/apps directory.
2)Open the file in a text editor or IDE of your choice.
3)Compile and run the program.
4)Follow the prompts.


# Description
This project utilized methods, contructors, class objects, and variable referencing to allow a user to input information for up to five food trucks. The user inputs a food truck name, food truck type and foot truck rating. Once the user enter five trucks, the food truck menu appears, If less than five trucks are enter and the user decides to enter quit, the food truck menu comes into view. The user can then select four options from the menu. The first option displays the food truck names, the second option displays the average food truck rating for all food trucks, the third option shows the food truck data for the highest rated food truck and the fourth allows the user to quit the program.

# Technology Used
Eclipse IDE was used to create the program.

# Lessons Learned
I learned how to create constructors and how to call the method within a class once a class object is created in the program. I learned create instances of a food truck and user class method to extract the data entered into an array. I struggled with the the adding to the array of class object, and using the data from a array that was not filled to capactity.  I fixed this issue be refactoring the length of the array to match the length of the data put in.
